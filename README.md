### How testing works

#### On start-up

Test suite truncates `Patient` and `Encounter` tables then creates set of search parameters indexes in order to reach the best performance

- `Patient.name`
- `Patient.name.family`
- `Patient.â€‹birthDate`

#### Testing

This performance tests run test suit on 2, 4, 8, and 16 threads. Each thread executes test 5000 times.
Each test does the following:
1. Creates Patient resource
2. Reads Patient by id
3. Creates Encounter resource
4. Reads Encounter by id
5. Searches count of Patients by name and birthDate
6. Searches count of Patients by family
